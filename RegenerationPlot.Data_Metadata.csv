Column Name,Description
Year,The year the plot was sampled.
Date.Sampled,The date the plot was sampled.
Plot.Type,"There are 5 types of plot: Hemlock, Ash, Burn, Random, Breeding Bird (BB). Plot type indicates what habitat plot is in: Eastern hemlock dominated, White ash dominated, Historic Prescribed Burn area, Randomly placed plots (forested), and Breeding Bird Survey research areas. "
Plot,The unique number assigned to the plot.
Regen.Plot,"The name of the Regeneration Plot. There are three Regeneration Plots per Forest Plot; UR, UL, BC. Each Regeneration Plot has a 2 meter radius. For more details on Regeneration Plots see SOP 10 - Microplot."
Species,The common name of the vegetation species.
Category,"The category of vegetation being recorded. Categories include Seedlings, Saplings, and Shrubs. Seedings are defined as live juvenile trees that are ≥15 cm tall and <1 cm DBH; Saplings are defined as juvenile trees ≥ 1 cm and < 10 cm DBH. Shrubs are defined as woody, sub-canopy species (woody vines included) and ≥30 cm tall."
Count,The number of individual stems of one species within a plot.
Height.Class,"The height of each seedling species measured in cm within each plot. Categories of height are 15-30 cm, 30-100 cm, 100-150 cm, and >150 cm. Heights of saplings and shrubs were not measured so ""NA"" is recorded."
Cover.%,"The estimated percent cover of each shrub species within each plot. Percent categories for estimation: <1, 1-5, 5-10, 10-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-95, 95-100%. Percent cover of seedlings and saplings were not measured so ""NA"" is recorded."
DBH.cm,"The DBH of each sapling species measured in cm within each plot. DBH of seedlings and shrubs were not measured so ""NA"" is recorded."
